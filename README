RTEMS GeSys ("Generic System") 
==============================

RTEMS GeSys is a general purpose application.
It is configured to support most of RTEMS' features
(all managers, networking, APIs) with generous limits.

A series of special linker scripts (contained in the
'config' directory) enforce GeSys to be linked with
most parts of the core system libraries (libc, libstdc++,
libgcc, librtemsbsp, librtemscpu etc.) including full
C++ support.

The initialization task initializes and runs Cexp
as a powerful shell. The idea is that GeSys be used
to load and start 'real' applications at run-time.

RTEMS GeSys has been tested on the following BSPs:

	powerpc-svgm, powerpc-mvme23xx, i386-pc?86
