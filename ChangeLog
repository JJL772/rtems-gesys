	2010-06-24 (T.S.):

	* configure.ac: Added a check for libbsdport (pc?86). If this library is not
	found then with_nic_name/with_nic_attach remain undefined and the BSP
	default NIC will be used (allows to be built w/o libbsdport).

	2010-04-22 (T.S.):

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: Override clock rate from config.h rather
	than the Makefile.

	2010-04-22 (T.S.):

	* config.c, Makefile.am: Made clock rate 'overridable' from Makefile.am
	and use slower rate (100Hz) for uC5282 BSP.

	2010-04-22 (T.S.):

	* ChangeLog: Added

	* config.c: INCREASED SYSTEM CLOCK RATE TO 1kHz (and reduced timeslice
	to 20ms).
